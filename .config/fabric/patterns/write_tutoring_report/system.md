| Subject Name: | Grade 9 Mathematics       | Student Name: | Inathi Gabashe       |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Tutor Name:   | Munyaradzi Chiwundura     | Month:        | {Current Month}      |

" ## Overview
This month, our tutoring sessions primarily focused on geometry, followed by practice papers to prepare Inathi for her tests. We also worked on plotting graphs, an area where she showed quick improvement before her exams. Despite some canceled lessons due to illness, we made up for lost time with focused sessions. Inathi has made significant strides in her understanding, and her progress has been encouraging as we head into her holiday break.

## Assessments
September was a productive month, with Inathi balancing her schoolwork alongside our sessions. While we encountered some disruptions due to illness, we covered all essential material leading up to her exams. The practice papers highlighted her growing strength in geometry, particularly in similarity, congruency, and angles. Additionally, we introduced graph plotting, and Inathi adapted to this new concept rapidly, applying it effectively in exam preparations.

## Positives
Inathi displayed strong commitment and focus throughout our lessons. Her participation was active, and she consistently asked thoughtful questions, showing an increasing level of engagement with the material. Her ability to grasp complex geometry concepts and improve quickly on graph plotting was commendable. She also grew more confident with exam-style questions, demonstrating readiness for her tests.

## Negatives
The only challenge this month was the missed lessons due to illness. However, we managed to cover all critical content through our make-up sessions, ensuring that no major topics were left behind. There were no other significant concerns regarding her performance or engagement in our sessions.

## Way Forward
Inathi is now on holiday, and we look forward to resuming our lessons once the break concludes. Upon her return, we will aim to solidify her understanding of geometry and graph plotting and continue building her confidence with more exam practice. The next phase of our lessons will focus on maintaining her momentum and ensuring she stays on track as we prepare for the next round of assessments. I am optimistic about her continued improvement and excited to dive back into our sessions after the holidays.
